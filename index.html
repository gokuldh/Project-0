  <h1>IMPORTANT CONCEPTS</h1>
  <h2>1. How The Web Works :</b>
  <p>
    The web can be defined as communications between a bunch of computers based on the user inputs.
    When a user searches any domain name or IP address like <a href="www.udacity.com">www.udacity.com</a>,
    their system shall send a <em>HTTP Request</em> to the respected <em>Server</em>. The server then
    locates the desired HTML page in it's directory and sends the data to the user's system where a
    <em>Web Browser</em> interprets the data and presents it on the user's system. Udacity has provided users with

    to help the developers learn about these concepts.

  <h2>2. HTML :</h2>
  <p>
    HTML stands for <em><b>HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE</b></em>. The web consists of huge stacks of HTML documents.
    HTML documents contain <em>Text Elements</em> which determine "The Visual Content" as well as <em>Markup Elements</em>
    which refers to "How It Looks". <em><b>HTML</b></em> is <em>THE</em> Language of Web Development. Usually HTML documents are stored on
    servers, which provide the necessary documents to the users whenver a user acceses a webpage. The data is sent to the user's
    System which is furthur interpretted by the Web Browser in use, this data is then displayed to the user.

  <h2>3. Tags And Elements :</h2>
  <p>
    A HTML documents consists of various <em>Elements</em>. While creating a HTML document, the developer specifies
    the type of each elemts which is to be interpretted by the Browser using <em>Tags</em>.
    Some of the tags are &lt;a&gt; tag, &lt;img&gt; tag, &lt;b&gt; tag etc.
    <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444">This video</a>
    explains the distinction well.

  <h2>4. Why Computers are Stupid :</h2>
  <p>Computers are so called stupid systems because they interpret instructions
      literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
      small mistake by a programmer can cause mny bugs
      in a program. they do whatever we make them to do. They just follows the instructions given to them.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h2>5. Inline vs Block Elements :</h2>
  <p>HTML elements are either <b>inline</b> or <b>block</b>. Block
      elements form an "invisible box" around the consisting content.
      some of the inline elements are &lt;b&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;span&gt; etc.
      Example of block elements are &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;form&gt; etc.
